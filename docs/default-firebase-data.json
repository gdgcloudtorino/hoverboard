Events may include talks, hackathons, codelabs, study jams, trainings with speakers from Google, Google Developers Experts, Women Techmaker Ambassadors and speakers from other companies.<br/><br/>This November, the 2nd and 3rd, Pescara will have its first DevFest. It will be exciting! We are not giving out any detail, yet, since they'll come in the next days. Stay tuned to know more about this great event, but hurry up, and get your RSVP!

      "content" : "Fixing other developers perplexing codes, bug that appear at the worst possible moment, bugs that reside in one of the used libraries, no backups, semicolon keys that seem to not work, no internet connection, undocumented code, Heisenbugs, merge conflicts, releases on Fridays. These are just a few of the worst nightmares for a developer.<br/><br/>DevFest Pescara 2019 will be our first DevFest. When we started thinking about it, we tried to figure out how we wanted to make it looks like. A conference, maybe? A meetup? Something mixed? Or maybe something different at all? We are a community, but almost everyone in the community is also a developer, and while we were brain storming about the main idea behind the event, during those precise weeks back in March, some of us were facing a lot of nightmares in the projects they were working on. Bugs, changes in the requirements just a few days before the release, a lot of uncertainty. A whole, big nightmare! The word \"nightmare\" was in our hears constantly, and something started to grow in our minds, like...an idea? Or should we say like a bug?<br/><br/>We do not even remember how, or precisely when, but we started thinking about how other developers would face our nightmare. We liked the thought of everyone in the community thinking about this topic and working together to give the others feedback, telling everyone tales about their own nightmares and how they solved them. We knew we wanted to organize our DevFest between October and November, and Halloween came in our minds in a blip. The connection is almost obvious, right? Halloween, Nightmares, a lot of people...<br/><br/>Our DevFest theme officially is \"Developers' Nightmares\". We named the whole event \"The DevFest Before Christmas\", freely getting inspired by Tim Burton's \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". We want to deliver an high quality event, full of interesting topics and a lot of networking opportunity, we want to make it funny and unforgettable. The DevFest will be a 2 days conference, with talks and workshops, but we are also organizing team building activities and a lot of entertaining activities specifically designed for easing networking.<br/><br/>Stay tuned to know every details, but get ready for a Networking and beer party on November the 2nd evening! We are giving a networking and beer party where cosplay is not just allowed, but...required! We want to see your creations, we want everyone at the party wearing something that recall a developer nightmare, and we want to see you lot wear an halloween costume.<br/><br/>[SPOILER ALERT]<br/>Come with us and you will see<br/>This community, our GDG<br/>This is DevFest, this is DevFest!",
