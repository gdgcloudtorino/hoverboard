## By train üöÑ
Pescara (Central) station lies on the Adriatic North-South route. Trenitalia Freccia, InterCity (daytime) and Intercity Notte (overnight) trains directly connect Pescara to Bologna, Milan, Turin and Venice to the north, and Bari, Brindisi and Lecce to the south.

There are regional trains connecting Pescara to Rome as well. Although they run on a spectacular route crossing the mountains, they take about twice as long as busses. So if you‚Äôre planning to come from Rome we strongly recommend you take the bus instead (see below).
